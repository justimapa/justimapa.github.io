            <h2>HackaHealth - Helping a Video Editor with Tremors</h2>
            <p><strong>Project Overview:</strong> During the HackaHealth hackathon, I developed a product to assist a video editor who suffers from tremors to use his mouse more effectively. The goal was to create a solution that would allow him to edit videos smoothly and accurately despite his condition.</p>

            <img src="images/hackahealth.jpg" alt="HackaHealth project image" class="project-image">

            <h3>The Problem:</h3>
            <p>The video editor struggled with the precision required for his work due to tremors in his hands, which often caused misclicks or difficulty controlling the mouse. Editing videos involves fine control, and his condition severely hindered his ability to use standard input devices effectively.</p>

            <h3>Our Solution:</h3>
            <p>We developed a prototype device with that used a combination of hardware and software to stabilize mouse movements. The device integrated with a specialized software that adjusted the sensitivity and movement of the mouse in real-time, effectively filtering out small, unintended tremors while still allowing the user to make intentional movements.</p>

            <h3>Key Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-time tremor filtering:</strong> The software detected tremors in the user's hand and smoothed out unwanted movements, giving the user better control over the mouse cursor.</li>
                <li><strong>Customizable sensitivity:</strong> The device allowed users to adjust the sensitivity and filtering level according to their preference, making it adaptable to different conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Seamless integration with video editing software:</strong> The device worked smoothly with popular video editing tools, providing an intuitive experience for the user.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tech Stack:</h3>
            <p>The project was developed using a combination of Python for the backend (for the software that filters tremors), along with hardware components including a custom-built motion-sensing input device (Rasberry PI) that communicated with the computer via USB.</p>

            <h3>Challenges Faced:</h3>
            <p>One of the main challenges was fine-tuning the real-time tremor filtering algorithm. It had to be precise enough to ignore small tremors while not interfering with intended movements. Additionally, ensuring compatibility with various video editing software was a significant technical hurdle, but through iterative testing and feedback, we were able to overcome it.</p>

            <h3>Impact:</h3>
            <p>After testing the prototype, the video editor was able to use his mouse more effectively, significantly reducing the strain caused by misclicks. This allowed him to complete tasks that were previously difficult or impossible, improving both his productivity and his overall quality of life.</p>

            <p>This project was a proud moment for me, as it combined technology and empathy to help someone overcome a real-world challenge. It demonstrated how innovation can be leveraged to make a meaningful difference in people’s lives.</p>
